My dotfiles
============

Including
----------

* `.vimrc` - which may call some special bash files
* `.tmux.conf` - pretty vanilla
* `set_tmux.sh` - sets up my sessions and windows. A work in progress.
* `build_unittest.py` - code generator for Python, Ruby, and Java class/unit tests

TODO
----------
* my ancient "run unit tests in vim" script
* more vim filters in python
* more tmux automation
